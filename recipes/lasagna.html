    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This 3 ingredient cheesy lasagna sheet pasta could not be easier. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, and freshly cracked black pepper if you like.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            8 ounces lasagna noodles, broken in half
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (24-ounce) jar tomato sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            8 ounces shredded whole milk mozzarella cheese
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasanga noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain noodles and return to the pot. Add tomato sauce and cook on medium heat until sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add cheese and stir until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
        </li>
